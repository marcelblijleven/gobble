# Gobble

Gobble lets you scrobble ðŸ¦ƒ

## Work in progress

Gobble is currently still in progress. Plex can already call Gobble, but the only thing
it does now is log the webhook event.

Upcoming:
* Call Discord / Slack webhook
* Syncing between Jellyfin and Plex

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a `gobble.yaml` file. See `gobble.example.yaml` for an example.
